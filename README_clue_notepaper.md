# Clue Notepaper 📝

A virtual notepad to enhance your experience while playing the classic board game Clue! Manage your cards, track your deductions, and reset easily for a new game.

## 🎯 Purpose

This app allows players to replace the physical detective notepaper with a digital version. Mark the cards you’ve seen, organize suspects, weapons, and rooms effortlessly, and never lose track of your game progress.
